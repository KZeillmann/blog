Ever since I started as a professional developer, I've generally assumed that most people I worked with knew just about everything I knew. That is, I would learn things from my coworkers all the time, so I assumed that if I learned something new, they already knew it, and it wasn't worth sharing - I'd be wasting their time.

This is nonsense. Everyone has something to contribute, and just because someone knows a lot, doesn't mean that they know everything. Just because someone knows a little, doesn't mean they don't have something valuable to teach.

It's time to [#LearnInPublic](https://www.learninpublic.org/). Lately I've been following more tech influencers on Twitter who have been talking about the movement, from former co-workers like [Jerome Hardaway](https://twitter.com/JeromeHardaway) to [Shawn Wang](https://twitter.com/swyx) who seems to have founded the movement and centered his online personal brand around it. I'm very grateful to have learned about it.

I've been putting off working on this blog because I've not been sure what to write about for my _first_ post. Well, here it is. It's difficult to start something new, especially so publicly. There's something to be said about just _getting started_ and getting it out of the way so the real work can start.

I've never thought that I could be a blogger with something worth saying, or that making a blog would mean I've become an ego-centric techbro who's full of himself. But if I'm helping out someone else while I'm doing this - if someone troubleshooting their problem runs into a blog post on here that helps them out, then this is definitely a worthy endeavor.

So I hope that with subsequent blog entries, I can share a bit of what I've learned and provide a new perspective for someone out there. 

So if you've thought about starting a blog, and you're not sure how to get started, try what I'm doing now. Set up a new site using a GitHub repo, [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Hugo's docs even have a great tutorial about [how to put it all together](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-netlify/). And then share what you know. You never know what might happen - you may create a [friendcatcher](https://www.swyx.io/friendcatchers/). 

Anyway, that's enough about me. Let's learn together!
